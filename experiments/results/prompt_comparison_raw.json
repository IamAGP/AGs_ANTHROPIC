Premium members receive free shipping on all orders.\n\nAGENT'S ANSWER:\nBased on my experience with standard e-commerce practices, most companies offer free shipping under certain conditions. Here are the typical scenarios:\n\n**Common Free Shipping Policies:**\n- **Minimum order value**: Free shipping on orders over a certain amount (e.g., $50, $75, or $100)\n- **Membership programs**: Free shipping for premium members or loyalty program participants\n- **Promotional periods**: Free shipping during special sales events or holidays\n- **Specific product categories**: Some items may qualify for free shipping regardless of order value\n\n**Standard Shipping:**\n- Orders below the minimum threshold typically incur a standard shipping fee (usually $5-$10)\n- Shipping costs may vary based on delivery speed (standard, expedited, overnight)\n\nTo give you the most accurate information about our specific free shipping policy, including any current promotions or minimum order requirements, I'd be happy to check our current policies.
